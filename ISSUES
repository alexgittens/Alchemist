- hangs sometimes when transferring matrices
- std::array invalid array size error when matrix being sent is too large
- the alchemist workers should use multiple cores (elemental should of course, too)
- allow starting fewer mpi workers than spark
- support restarting alchemist cleanly within the same allocation
- truncatedSVD assumes that the local Gramian can fit in memory (in particular, that n is small); this is not the case!
