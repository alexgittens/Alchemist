Protocol between Spark Driver and Alchemist Driver (AlDriver):
  - Spark Driver sends sequence of commands to AlDriver, and AlDriver sends
    replies synchronously
  - all values are sent and received in network byte order
  - each command starts with a 32-bit "message type" field.

  - MESSAGE TYPES
    - handshake
      cmd:
        uint32_t typeCode = 0xABCD
        uint32_t protocolVersion = 0x1

      reply:
        uint32_t statusCode = 0xDCBA
        uint32_t protocolVersion = 0x1
        uint32_t numWorkers = number of AlWorkers
        WorkerInfo workers[numWorkers]


    - shutdown
        uint32_t typeCode = 0xFFFFFFFF

      reply:
        uint32_t statusCode = 0x1

    - newMatrix
        uint32_t typeCode = 0x1
        uint64_t numRows
        uint64_t numCols
        uint64_t numWorkers
        // each entry of layout must be number of rows to be recvd by that worker
        uint32_t layout[numWorkers]

      reply 1: "ready for receiving data"
        uint32_t statusCode = 0x1
        uint32_t matrixHandle

      [then spark sends data to workers]

      reply 2: "matrix successfully loaded"
        uint32_t statusCode = 0x1

    - matrixMul
        uint32_t matrixHandle 
        uint32_t matrixHandle 

      reply:
        uint32_t statusCode = 0x1
        uint32_t matrixHandle

  - STRUCTS
    - string
      uint32_t length
      uint8_t data[length]

    - WorkerInfo:
        string hostname
        uint32_t port


Block transfer protocol of AlWorker:
  uint32_t typeCode = 0x1
  uint32_t matrixHandle
  uint64_t rowIdx
  uint64_t numCols
  double rowData[numCols]
